# raft
## raft to build RSM

raft protocol ensures consistence logs across all servers have the same committed log entries. After applying all commited log on the state machines, we can get valid replicas.

## some properties
* single leadera
* leader election
* term as the logic clock

## election details
?: each candidate can vote 2 votes: 1 for self and 1 for others --> no, only 1 vote. if a candidate receives a vote request with same term, it won't agree. if receives a vote request with higher term, it becomes a follower and reset the voteFor field and vote as usual. It would be a case that at startup, all server claim themself as candidate and reject others' vote request. If the timeing become candidate are always exactly the same, then no chances to elect a leader. Random sleep makes the election less chances to fail.
